## Overview

I chose this project because I think it's very useful to know how to build a checkout site nowadays. It's one of the type of sites we see and use the most, and almost every website that offers a service has one. Therefore, I think it could be very useful for me to learn how to create one. The next step will be learning how to add JS to it so that it works properly! But that's for another project.

The biggest challenge for me was learning how to create the buttons in the cart. I struggled a lot with that particular part and it took me hours to figure out the structure.

Then I also had to learn how to work with the text boxes, inserting placeholder text and styling it, and inserting svg icons. I also had a bit of a struggle with the two sections of the site and trying to make them stay where I wanted them to be.

What I've learned is that I have to stop fearing divs and classes. I have to create as many divs and classes as I need in order to move elements around as I need them to.
